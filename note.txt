pdf query with langchain and cassandradb- platform datastackx, creates db in cloud, perform vector search,
qa app, from huge pdf=vector search



pdf,any size,pages ---- read the document ----- text chunks(1 to n packets) --- each chunks converted to    
                                                                                text embeddings(using openai embedding ie text into vectors)
                                                                                because when we convert text to vectors, we can perform classification, similarity algo etc.
                                                                                |
                                                                                |
                                                                                |
                                                                                huge pdf, vector size is more, so we store in vectordb(cassandradb)
                                                                                                      (nosql apache database, fast)

human - text query related to pdf document - similarity search along with text embeddings, gets specific response.

research paper key points: 7b, 13b, 70b parameters, context length=4096
pretrained on 2trilion tokens
benchmarks=mmlu(human level understanding, this is more), humaneval(with respect to writing code, this is less)
opensource innovation to ai.
how trained, datapoints etc.
public data is used, no personal data, nvidia(A100) gpu will be used to training.
standard transformer architecture is used.
reinforcement learning is used(RLHF), supervised finetuning(SFT)
